            <p><strong>Backstreet Boys</strong> are an American vocal group, formed in Orlando, Florida in 1993. The group consists of Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, 
                AJ McLean, and cousins Brian Littrell and Kevin Richardson. They became famous in the 90's with their debut international album,<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys" target="_blank"> 
                Backstreet Boys(1996).</a></em> They released their second international album,<em> Backstreet's Back (1997)</em>, folowed by the third and fourth albums respectively, <em>Millennium (1999)</em> and <em>Black & Blue (2000)</em>.
    
                After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album <em>Never Gone (2005).</em> After the conclusion of the Never Gone Tour 
                in 2006, Kevin Scott Richardson left the group to pursue other interests. The group then released two albums as a quartet: <em>Unbreakable (2007) </em>and 
                <em>This Is Us (2009)</em>.
                
                In 2012, the group announced that Richardson had rejoined them permanently. The following year, they celebrated their 20th anniversary 
                and released their first independent album, <em>In a World Like This (2013)</em>.

                On January 25, 2019,the group released their 9th studio album <em>DNA</em> through a collaboration with the group's own K-BAHN record label and RCA Records.

            <p><strong>Why the Backstreet Boys?</strong></p>
            
            <P>
            Boy bands come and go, but the Backstreet Boys are forever! The now-iconic group has been on the scene for over three decades with no signs of stopping, 
            having sold over 180 million albums worldwide, making them the most popular boy band of all time in terms of sales, and one of the world's 
            best-selling music artists.I'd always pick them over any other bands because of the following reasons:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Their music never gets old. If you walk into an arena and a Backstreet song is playing, most people will be signing along. Their is a song for every emotion 
                    you could possibly ever feel. You can call their songs cheesy maybe and I am a fun of cheesy music. Music to lighten your soul.
                </li>
                <li>Their personalities and love for fans. It's impressive that they have the same fun-loving personalities as when they first started the group. All are very 
                    different from each other, but still extremely funny and charismatic. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Their songs make you want to join in and dance. Everyone knows signature boy band dancing, but in the '90s it was at another level. I mean, who could forget 
                    the moves in “Backstreet's Back”?
                    That signature “rock your body right” move will live on forever.
                </li>
                <li>Their undeniable swag.</li>
                <li>Their voices are so beautiful, in every single way possible. I mostly like Nick's and Kevin's voices.</li>
            </ul>

            <p id="title_bm">My favorite songs and album by the band</p>  
            <p> Even though i love all the songs sang by Backstreet, there are these four songs that i love most from the <em><b>'DNA' </b></em>album (my favorite), which i could listen to all day long.
                "No Place" in the album is the most favourite song of the four especially the lines sang by Nick '..I’ve been all around the world, done all there is to do
                But you’ll always be the home I wanna come home to...'. You can always check the songs out on youtube:
